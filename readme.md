This project is a simple command-line task tracker built with Python. To run it, ensure you have Python installed and the rich library (install via pip install rich). Save the script as task_tracker.py and run it from your terminal with python task_tracker.py. The program stores all tasks in a CSV file named tasks.csv, which is created automatically if it doesn't exist. The CSV file records each task's ID, description, status (todo or done), notes, timestamps, and total time tracked.

The application's core functions include adding, updating, deleting, listing tasks, marking them as done, and viewing statistics via a text-based bar chart. It features an interactive menu that updates dynamically and visually, with a colored bar chart displaying progress. All data persists across sessions, with user inputs processed sequentially in the terminal. This project leverages AI for initial guidance, code suggestions, and formatting support, ensuring a clean, user-friendly experience.
